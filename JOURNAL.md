## 10/31/2025 - Routed the PCB  

I routed the PCB today and finalized the LED Catcher Circuit. At first, it was confusing as I didn't know how to wire each side when the wires can't go through each other. However, I figured out you can use a bottom and top layer to do so. Even then it was hard to make the perfect connections, but I made it through. I ran the Design Check and I had 42 errors, which I thought wasn't bad. I went one by one and fixed the errors, most of which was width errors and I had to make the lines .3mm instead of .15. The layout is pretty choppy, but I think I did well for my very first PCB. ![{0D12FB5E-67AC-4FEE-9D53-E6DE940EF3AE}](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzI3NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--64c91aa75ef7f485552874ee62fd99ce2f4641d4/%7B0D12FB5E-67AC-4FEE-9D53-E6DE940EF3AE%7D.png)![3D View](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzI3NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0952755718430a28ffdea19ca222b258f8bdcbe9/3D%20View.png)
